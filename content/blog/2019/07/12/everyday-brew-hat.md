A few weeks ago, when I was really enjoying monogamously working on my Rose Cardigan once my knitting mojo had returned, Jose told me he wanted a new hat. I am always happy to knit for Jose, as he is always incredibly appreciative of anything I make him. However, this hat had a deadline: It needed to be completely done/ready to pack by July 4. Jose was preparing for a trip to hike Mount Kilimanjaro, and needed a very warm hat for the colder parts of the hike. That gave me about a week and a half to make it, which was doable, but it meant I had to stop working on my cardigan temporarily.

I decided to knit the [Everyday Brew]('https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/everyday-brew') hat from Claire Devine’s Tea Collection, which has been a go-to hat collection for me for a few years now. The hat calls for bulky weight yarn, but as Jose was insistent I use some of my remaining Gynx Yarn for it, I ended up going for a worsted weight and held it double. I had a skein of Gynx Yarns Merino Worsted in the Campfire colorway, which I knew he’d love, so I set out to knit it.

The hat itself knit up extremely fast. Large yarn + large needles is a great combo for a fast finished project. However, as I was finishing the hat, I worried that it might not actually be warm enough. I was surprised that the worsted weight held double on size US 10.5 needles didn’t seem super dense. It would definitely be warm enough for even the coldest of Dallas winters, but for 0 - 10 degree Fahrenheit weather with who knows how much wind, I wasn’t as confident. After consulting to of my colder climate friends, I decided to knit a lining into the hat.

I picked up and knit on the inside of the hat just after the ribbing ended. I went with size US 4 needles, so the lining wasn’t super dense either, but it added a nice extra layer. I actually alternated two scraps of sock weight yarn: one was leftovers of my Red XIII colorway I used in my Rainbow in the Storm sweater, and the other was some very old Another Crafty Girl scraps. I wanted to only use the Another Crafty Girl yarn, but I was worried I wouldn’t have enough (in hindsight, I totally could have only used it). The Red XIII was more red than I wanted, so I mixed the two to mellow out the red and bring it to a more orange tone overall.

Once I knit the lining, I still wasn’t done. Jose surprised me when he asked for the hat to have a pom pom. He’s never had a hat with a pom pom before, so I assumed it just wasn’t his thing. But no, he was determined it NEEDED a pom pom. When I pointed out he’d probably be wearing a hood at some points, he asked if I could make it detachable. I ended up attaching a snap to the top of the hat so that he could remove the pom pom whenever he wanted to. He then asked if I could make multiple pom poms so he could change the look of the hat, but I told him he definitely didn’t need that until after the hike.

I finished the hat with about a day to spare, and Jose climbed the mountain with it. He said that his head was never cold and he did utilize the snap to remove the pom pom a couple of times, so all of my work was worth it in the end. Now when he gets back, I apparently need to make a couple more pom poms for him!
